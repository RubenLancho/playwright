# Playwright Testing Project

## Overview
This project is a testing framework built using Playwright and TypeScript. It is designed to facilitate automated testing of web applications, providing a robust environment for writing and executing tests.

## Project Structure
```

├── tests
│   ├── example.spec.ts
│   └── helpers
│       └── utils.ts
├── playwright.config.ts
├── package.json

└── README.md
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd playwright-testing-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   To execute the tests, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```

## Usage Examples
- The sample test case can be found in `tests/example.spec.ts`. This file demonstrates how to interact with a web page and assert conditions using Playwright.

## Suggested Improvements
1. Add more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
2. Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing on code changes.
3. Integrate reporting tools to generate test reports.
4. Add more utility functions in `tests/helpers/utils.ts` for better code reuse.
5. Use environment variables for configuration settings.
6. Implement visual regression testing.
7. Add support for multiple browsers in the tests.
8. Create a custom test runner script for better control over test execution.
